# Image Converter - An Image Resizer Extension
## An useful chrome extension, specifically for designers and developers

A **chrome extension to import images** either from a URL, or from your device, and **convert them into another format -- JPG, WEBP, PNG, all done locally** (so, *internet is not required*, and you can *convert as many times as you want to!*)

This extension's sole purpose is to save your time & increase your productivity as a developer / designer.
Finding the right image just to notice that it's in the wrong format gets frustrating rather quick, and we always have to search up a website just to convert its format. Other extensions are mostly bloated with extra stuff, making it slow in nature. I aim to remove all those bloat and ADs with this, by making it open-source as well :)

### UI / UX
I provide a simple and easy-to-understand user experience with a clean UI; everything is pretty straightforward and easy to understand. There is also an **option for dark and light themes** -- for people with different preferences!

### How to Run Locally
You have the option to [**download this extension from the chrome store**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/image-converter/gcekcldbeflpkgoedcjpafndgjkmpkdk/), but if you choose not to and want to run it locally instead:
- clone this github repo
  > git clone https://github.com/sanchxt/image-converter-extension.git

- Enable developer mode [here](chrome://extensions/) (**make sure to open this link in Chrome!**)

- On Chrome, in the above link, click on **Load Unpacked**

- Choose the path to that directory, and add the extension

- You can find it in your extensions tab. If it isn't visible, make sure it is enabled

Feel free to contribute, and if you liked this, I would appreciate it if you could rate my extension! :)
